  "body": "### Overview\r\nWelcome to Faire. Faire is an apt-get frontend for the lazy. It is simple to install and easy to use. Faire was created with laziness in mind, because typing `sudo apt-get` is too much work in my opinion. Look at Arch Linux. All you have to type is `pacman -S` (I think.) The recommended installation is to use `git clone` but if you want to be a rebel, go ahead.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nOK Now we gon' install this\r\n\r\ntype in `chmod +x install.sh`\r\n\r\nCool. Now type `./install.sh` \r\n\r\nAaaand the work is done. Now all you have to type is `faire -i <package>` and wait. Get a snack or go to the bathroom if you need.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nREADME.md needs an Update (its in the works chill out.)\r\n\r\n`-i` Installs packages\r\n\r\n`-u` Updates your packages\r\n\r\n`-U` Upgrades packages (case sensitive)\r\n\r\n`-f` Fixes broken packages (its literally `sudo apt-get update --fix-missing`.)",
